   Geometry: area of a triangle 
           (stage 1)
1. prompt user to enter three points of a triangle 
2. display its area 

           (stage 2)
1. prompt user to enter three points
2. collect the points 
3. store the points as (side1),(side2),(side3)
4. calculate for sides = (side1) + (side2) + (side3)/2
5. store the result as sides
6. calculate for area using the formula: Math.sqrt(s(s - side1)(s - side2)(s _ side#)
7. store result as area
