     Arithmetic 
      (stage one)
1. Ask user to enter two integers
2. obtain them from the user
3. Square each 
4. sum of their square
5. difference of the squares

     (stage two)
1. prompt user to enter a first integer
2. collect the integers 
3. store integer as first integer
4. prompt user to enter a secound integer
5. collect the integer
6. store integer as secound integer
7. calculate square of first integer :  (first integer * First integer)
8 store result as square of first integer
8. calculate square of second integer : (second integer * second integer)
9. store the as square of first integer
10. calculate the sum of their squares : square of first integer + square of second integer
11. store result as sum of their squares
12. calculate the difference of their squares : square of first integer - square of second integer
13. store the result as difference of their squares.
